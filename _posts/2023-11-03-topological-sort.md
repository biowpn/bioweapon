## Intro

[Topological sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) comes up often in applications such as task schedulers, dependency resolvers, and node-based computation engines. Let's try to design and implement generic topological sorting in C++.

Specifically, we want to implement `topological_sort` with the following signature:

```cpp
template< class RandomIt, class F >
void topological_sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, F edge );
```

- `[first, last)` denotes a list of vertices.
- `edge` is a callable such that:
  - If there is an edge from `u` to `v`, then `edge(u, v)` returns `true`
  - Otherwise, `edge(u, v)` returns `false`



## Can we reuse `std::sort`?

As a rule of thumb, if there's something in the standard library that solves our problem,
we should preferably use them.

We have a candidate: `std::sort` (and `std::ranges::sort`). Its API looks like:

```cpp
/// Sorts the elements in the range [`first`, `last`) in non-descending order,
/// with respect to a comparator `comp`.
template< class RandomIt, class Compare >
void sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );
```

And what is `comp`? `comp(x, y)` returns `true` if and only if `x` is "less than" `y`. This seems to match our `edge` comparator exactly:

- A Vertex `u` is "less than" `v` if there is an edge from `u` to `v`
- For example, if the vertices represent tasks, when it means `u` must be completed before `v`

So, can we simply

```cpp
template< class RandomIt, class F >
void topological_sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, F edge ) {
    std::sort(first, last, edge);
}
```

and call it a day? Does it work?


## It Does Not.

Let's try it with an example. The graph looks like this:

![plot](https://github.com/biowpn/bioweapon/blob/main/images/tp_sort_graph_1.png?raw=true)

There are exactly 3 topological orderings of the graph:
- `ABCD`
- `ACBD`
- `ACDB`

The following program generates all permutations of the vertices, supplies them to `std::sort`, and shows the output:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string vertices{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};
    auto edge = [](char u, char v) {
        return (u == 'A' && v == 'B')
            || (u == 'A' && v == 'C')
            || (u == 'C' && v == 'D')
            ;
    };

    do {
        auto sorted = vertices;
        std::sort(sorted.begin(), sorted.end(), edge);
        std::cout << vertices << " --> " << sorted << '\n';
    } while (std::next_permutation(vertices.begin(), vertices.end()));
}
```

Compiled using GCC 13.1.0, the above program prints:

```
ABCD --> ABCD
ABDC --> ABCD
ACBD --> ACBD
ACDB --> ACDB
ADBC --> ADBC
ADCB --> ACDB
BACD --> ABCD
BADC --> ABCD
BCAD --> ABCD
BCDA --> ABCD
BDAC --> ABCD
BDCA --> ABCD
CABD --> ACBD
CADB --> ACDB
CBAD --> ACBD
CBDA --> ACBD
CDAB --> ACDB
CDBA --> ACDB
DABC --> CDAB
DACB --> CDAB
DBAC --> CDAB
DBCA --> ACDB
DCAB --> ACDB
DCBA --> ACDB
```

As we can see, there are 3 cases where the outputs are wrong:

```
DABC --> CDAB
DACB --> CDAB
DBAC --> CDAB
```

So what's going here?



## Preconditions of `std::sort`

As another rule of thumb, if a standard library algorithm, especially a long-lived and well-tested one like `std::sort`, produces unexpected results, it's most likely our fault of providing bad inputs - inputs that violate the preconditions.

But in our cases:
- We provided a random-access sequence
- We provided a comparator that matches the required signature

And in fact, in any of the above fails to hold, we would get a hard compile error.

Reading again the [the sort documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort), more carefully this time:

> **comp** - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the requirements of ***Compare***) which returns `â€‹true` if the first argument is less than (i.e. is ordered *before*) the second.

What are the requirements of *Compare*? In the [documentation of Compare](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Compare), we have this section:

> Establishes *strict weak ordering* relation with the following properties:
1. For all `a`, `comp(a, a) == false`.
2. If `comp(a, b) == true` then `comp(b, a) == false`.
3. If `comp(a, b) == true` and `comp(b, c) == true` then `comp(a, c) == true`.

`edge` satisfies 1 and 2, but not 3: `edge(A, C) == true` and `edge(C, D) == true`, but `edge(A, D) == false`.

So that must be it, right? We just need to change `edge` to `path` and it'll work?

- `path(u, v)` returns true if and only iff there is a path from `u` to `v` (which contains one or more edges)

Hold on a second. There's another section on `equiv(a, b)`, which is defined as `!comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a)` (`a` and `b` are considered *equal* if neither precedes the other), as follows:

> Establishes *equivalence relationship* with the following properties:
...
4. If `equiv(a, b) == true` and `equiv(b, c) == true`, then `equiv(a, c) == true`

**This (equivalence relationship) is where the real trouble is**.

In our example, `equiv(B, C) == true` and `equiv(B, D) == true`, therefore `std::sort` goes ahead and assumes `equiv(C, D) == true`, which is incorrect, because `C` is in fact less than `D` since there is an edge from `C` to `D`. Therefore, even if we replace `edge` with `path`, 4 (equivalence relationship) is still violated.

But why is this such a big deal? Why can't it "just work"?

Let's forget `std::sort` for a moment and look at the simpler `std::is_sorted`. Recall the definition of "sorted sequence" states that *every* pair is ordered correctly, so there should be `O(N^2)` checks to be thorough, but `std::is_sorted` runs in `O(N)` time. How is that possible?

As you may already know it, `std::is_sorted` only checks the adjacent pairs. All the rest are *inferred*, and it is allowed to do so because of the properties of *Compare*! In our example, `std::is_sorted` will happily consider `DABC` "sorted", while in fact it is not.

In general, any algorithm that requires *Compare* (read: *strict weak ordering*), including `std::sort`, cannot be used to implement topological sorting because the vertices of a directed acyclic graph do not form a strict weak ordering.



## What do we do instead?

We may implement topological sort from scratch.

The naive way is to do a modified insertion sort:
In each iteration, we find a source - a vertex without any incoming edge,
then we put it at the front.

```cpp
/// topological sort, the brute force
template< class RandomIt, class F >
void topological_sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, F edge ) {
    for (; first != last; ++first) {
        // check if *first is a source.
        for (auto other = std::next(first); other != last; ++other) {
            if (edge(*other, *first)) {
                // *first is not a source; *other may be
                std::swap(*other, *first);
                // IMPORTANT! have to do the full search again for the new *first
                other = first;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is short and concise, requires constant extra memory, but what about the time complexity?

Note that due to the important `other = first` inside the nested loop,
this solution is `O(|V|^3)` in time, where `|V|` is the number of vertices.

Alternatively, we could use Kahn's algorithm. The rough idea is:

1. Put all the sources into a queue `S`
2. Remove a source, `u`, from `S`, and output `u`
3. Remove all outgoing edges of `u`
4. Some (previous) direct successor of `u`, `v`, may become a source; if so, add `v` to `S`
5. Go back to step 2 until `S` is empty

```cpp
/// topological sort, Kahn's algorithm
template< class RandomIt, class F >
void topological_sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, F edge ) {
    std::size_t n = std::ranges::distance(first, last);
    std::vector<std::size_t> in_degree(n);

    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (std::size_t j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            in_degree[i] += bool(edge(first[j], first[i]));
        }
    }
    
    // [s_first, s_last) are the sources of the sub-graph [s_first, last)
    auto s_first = first;
    auto s_last = s_first;

    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (in_degree[i] == 0) {
            std::swap(first[i], *s_last);
            std::swap(in_degree[i], in_degree[s_last - first]);
            ++s_last;
        }
    }

    for (; s_first != s_last; ++s_first) {
        for (auto t_it = s_last; t_it != last; ++t_it) {
            if (edge(*s_first, *t_it) && --in_degree[t_it - first] == 0) {
                std::swap(*t_it, *s_last);
                std::swap(in_degree[t_it - first], in_degree[s_last - first]);
                ++s_last;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Kahn's algorithm runs in `O(|V| + |E|)` time, where `|E|` is the number of edges.
For a dense graph, `|E| ~ |V|^2`, therefore our algorithm runs in `O(|V|^2)`.



## Afterword

We showed that why `std::sort` cannot be used for topological sorting,
and then implemented topological sorting under a similar API.

Perhaps, a few more finite graph algorithms can be implemented in this flavor:

```cpp
template <class RandomIt, class F>
RandomIt find_cycle(RandomIt first, RandomIt last, F edge);

template <class RandomIt, class F, class V>
void depth_first_search(RandomIt first, RandomIt last, F edge, V visitor);

...
```

Am I dreaming `std::graphs`? Maybe one day. Maybe.
